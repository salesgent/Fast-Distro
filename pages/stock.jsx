                You may ONLY return new, sealed, unopened items within 30 days
                of delivery for a full account credit. No return will be

                WE DO NOT ACCEPT RETURNS FOR THE FOLLOWING ITEMS:
                e-liquids/e-juice, disposables, consumable items and clearance
                items, no exceptions. Damaged/missing item exchanges must be
                reported within 48 hours of delivery to qualify for the return
                authorization process.
              </p>
              <p>
                We&apos;ll also pay the return shipping costs if the return is a
                result of our error (you received an incorrect or defective
                item, etc). You should expect to receive your refund within two
                weeks of giving your package to the return shipper, however, in
                many cases you will receive a refund more quickly. This time
                period includes the transit time for us to receive your return
                from the shipper (5 to 10 business days), and the time it takes
                us to process your return once we receive it (3 to 5 business
                days). If you need to return an item, please contact us with
                your order number and details about the product you would like
                to return. We will respond quickly with instructions for how to
                return items from your order.
